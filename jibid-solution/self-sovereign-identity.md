# Self-Sovereign Identity

JIBID champions the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI), where users are the ultimate custodians of their personal data. This paradigm shift allows individuals to own, control, and share their identity information as they see fit. With JIBID, identity verification becomes a consent-driven process, ensuring that usersâ€™ privacy is respected and maintained.
